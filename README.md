# MMPE_CUDA

In the early 90’s, a numerical code known as the University of Miami Parabolic
Equation (UMPE) Model was documented and made available to the general research
community.[1] This model was based on the split-step Fourier (SSF) technique[2], and had
been adapted from previous versions developed by Fred Tappert at the University of
Miami. A subsequent version, known as the Monterey-Miami Parabolic Equation
(MMPE) Model, was developed in the mid-90’s that was more streamlined and userfriendly.

For my master's work, I (Jing Luo) added the CUDA GPU acceleration to the code, which can speed up the simulation to 10x.
